<h2>what is assassins?</h2>
<p>
  While different rounds may have twists and variations,
  the basic game of Assassins is fairly straightforward:
  One player is randomly designated the Assassin,
  and must try to exterminate all other players.
  The other players must discover the identity of the Assassin, and kill him.
  The game is over when either the Assassin is stopped,
  or all other players are dead.
